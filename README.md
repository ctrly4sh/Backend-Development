Learning backend with : Node.js & Express.js
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Node or Express ?
=> Node.js : Purpose: Runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. <br>
             Strengths: High concurrency, real-time applications, and I/O-heavy tasks.
             Pros: Single-threaded, scalable, extensive module ecosystem.
             Cons: Low-level, requires manual handling of server-side tasks.
  Express.js:
             Purpose: Web application framework built on Node.js.
             Strengths: Rapid web application development, middleware support, and routing.
             Pros: Minimalistic, flexible, rich ecosystem, middleware integration.
             Cons: Adds abstraction layer, potential performance overhead.
